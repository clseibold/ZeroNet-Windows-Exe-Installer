This is a Windows Exe Installer for the decentralized and distributed internet project [ZeroNet](https://www.zeronet.io/). It will:
1. Install ZeroNet into Program Files (x86) directory
2. Register ZeroNet with Windows (with a guid)
3. Add shortcuts to ZeroNet, Data directory, and uninstaller in Start Menu
4. Add shortcut to ZeroNet on Desktop
5. Provide option to install @gitcenter 's new P2P Message Plugin for ZeroNet - which you can test with his new [IRC Zite](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FEL2HhvS48m8SsAPcuyo7irf7J9Ebx449/) - With this new plugin, zites can broadcast messages, which are then distributed throughout the system. These messages are not written to disk, but rather stored in memeory. This also allows the zite owner to determine the timeout for these messages, so that it doesn't have to be 30 seconds. There are more features being worked on, but they are not working yet. **You must have this plugin to use this IRC zite.**
6. Provide option to uninstall. Uninstall will **not** delete your data directory by default. However, you will be prompted during installation whether you want the data directory deleted.
